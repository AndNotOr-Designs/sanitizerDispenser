 Hand Sanitizer Dispenser
 
 ##Inspiration
 Covid-19 SUCKS! I wanted to have something in my office that shows off my electronics hobbies. This hackathon is perfect time since there's a hardware hack. 
 
## What it does
When the green LED is light, bring your hand close to the sensor and when the yellow LED turns on, sit still and wait for the red LED to turn on at which a pump of hand sanitzer will be pumped into your hand. After a short pump of sanitizer, the yellow LED will illuminate indicating it is verifying something is still close for dispensing. If nothing is there the green LED will come on indicating it is ready for next sensing.

## How it was built
Arduino IDE with a nano and a 6VDC pump and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measuring.
